# The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors -- [[live]](https://isimeri.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/)

My take on the classic little game that everyone knows and loves.

The rules are simple:
- Rock beats Scissors  
- Scissors beat Paper  
- Paper beats Rock

The first to reach 5 wins is the overall winner. Human vs computer mode only.
